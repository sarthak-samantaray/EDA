    "The smaller the value, more powerful is the regularization.\n",

    "6. **max_iter** : The number of epochs your algorithm takes to converge.\n",

    "8. **warm_start** : If we stopped the training in the middle, it can be resumed from where it has left off.\n",
    "9. **n_jobs** : if set to -1, it will use all the cpu cores.\n",
    "10. **l1_ratio** : if equal to 0 that is l2, if equal to 1, that is l1. If inbetween 0 and 1 , mixture of both l1 and l2."
